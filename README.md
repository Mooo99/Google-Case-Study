Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

Introduction: 
"In this case study, I will carry out various real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company called Cyclistic. To address the main business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act."

Business Task
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Objectives: 
•	Analyze Cyclistic's bike trip data to understand how annual members and casual riders utilize the service differently.
•	Develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members based on data insights.
•	Utilize Power BI for visualizations to present key findings and support decision-making processes.

Prepare:
        Data source
     I plan to analyze Cyclistic’s historical trip data from May 2023 to April 2024, which can be downloaded from divvy_tripdata. The data has been made           available by Motivate International Inc. under this license	 
Process:
1.	Data imported from GCS to BigQuery for combining, exploration, cleaning, and analysis. 
2.	Checked datatypes and made it consistent, and easy to read. 
3.	To assist the analysis, 4 new columns were created (day_of_week, month, and ride_duration).  

Data manipulation process: 
- Data Combining: Query
- Data Exploration Query
- Data Cleaning: Query
